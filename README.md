# efood-lifetime-expenses

A simple node script that calculates the total amount spent on e-food service.

## Before you start

At root level, there's a file named `.test.env`. Rename it to just `.env` and replace the value of `ACCESS_TOKEN` to your access token.

To get your token from e-food, visit [e-food](https://www.e-food.gr/), login (if not already logged-in), open your browser's dev tools, select Console and type `window.app.userSid`.

## Installation

If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)/[yvm](https://github.com/tophat/yvm) installed, at root level there are `.nvmrc` and `.yvmrc` files which help install the correct versions of node and yarn.  

If you don't, then advise these files to download and install the correct versions.

```bash
  nvm use && yvm use
  yarn install
```

## Usage

To calculate total expenses, run the following command
```bash
yarn calculate
```

If for any reason installation failed, run `yarn clean` and start all over again.

## Output

```bash
[{ ... }]

Number of shops: <X>.
Total amount of orders: <Y>.
Period from YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD.
Total amount spent in e-food is â‚¬<Z>.
```

## Roadmap
